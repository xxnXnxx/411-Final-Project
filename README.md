## Game Mechanics

- **Objective**: The goal of the game is to accumulate experience (EXP) points by clicking on the laptop icon, which generates EXP. The player can use this EXP to purchase upgrades, each improving the player's EXP multiplier or adding passive income sources like interns.
- **Upgrades**:
  - **WPM Boost**: Increases the EXP multiplier.
  - **Interns**: Generates passive EXP over time.
  - **Algorithm Upgrade**: Increases the EXP multiplier with an algorithm-based upgrade.
- **EXP Display**: The player's EXP is displayed on the main screen and is updated as the player earns EXP.
- **Upgrade Menu**: The upgrade menu allows players to spend EXP to buy upgrades that improve the game's performance or provide passive bonuses.
